# Tamagotchi.Solution

## By [Sammai](https://github.com/sammaicodes) and [Tom](https://github.com/usarneme)
### Description

This is a web application similar to Tamagotchi Pets. You can create as many pets as you want with different stats based on their class/type but make sure you are taking care of them as they will die if they don't get enough food, attention, and rest (kinda morbid for a kids game...).
